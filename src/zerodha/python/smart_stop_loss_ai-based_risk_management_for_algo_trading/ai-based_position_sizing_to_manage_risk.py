'''Step 1: AI-Powered Smart Stop Loss Calculation
We’ll use Machine Learning to calculate optimal stop-loss levels dynamically.
 Calculate Dynamic Stop Loss Based on Volatility

Step 2: AI-Based Position Sizing to Manage Risk
We’ll adjust position sizes dynamically based on market risk.
 Calculate Position Size Based on Risk Tolerance

# Dynamically adjusts stop-loss based on market volatility.

    max_risk = account_balance * risk_per_trade
    position_size = max_risk / (current_price - smart_stop_loss(current_price))

# Example Usage
account_balance = 100000  # ₹1 Lakh
print(f"Recommended Position Size: {position_sizing(account_balance)} shares")

# Ensures controlled risk per trade based on account balance.
