'''Step 1: AI-Powered Smart Stop Loss Calculation
We’ll use Machine Learning to calculate optimal stop-loss levels dynamically.
 Calculate Dynamic Stop Loss Based on Volatility

Step 2: AI-Based Position Sizing to Manage Risk
We’ll adjust position sizes dynamically based on market risk.
 Calculate Position Size Based on Risk Tolerance

 Step 3: AI-Based Risk Management & Trade Execution
Now, we’ll automate trade execution based on stop loss & position size.
 Execute Trades with AI Risk Management
